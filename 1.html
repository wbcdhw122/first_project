    Down that long black road<br>
    You'll find sunshine showers<br>
    And maybe love to behold<br>
    But, can you keep a secret?<br>
    Can you keep a secret?</p>

    <p>Keep on reaching<br>
    Up for a higher ground<br>
    But don't keep on preaching<br>
    From that book you found<br>
    Can you keep a secret?<br>
    Can you keep a secret?</p>

    <p>I can play it on an old guitar<br>
    You can sing it like a monkey man<br>
    Don't speak of soul 'cause you've got none</p>

    <p>And all the kids in a funky bar<br>
    Dressing down like a bogeyman<br>
    If they don't mind and you don't mind<br>
    I'm gonna write that in a song</p>

    <p>But can you keep a secret?<br>
    Can you keep a secret? (Keep on reaching up for a higher ground)<br>
    Can you keep a secret? (Keep on reaching up for a higher ground)<br>
    Can you keep a secret? (Keep on reaching up for a higher ground)<br>
    Can you keep a secret?â€¦</p>
