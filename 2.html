      The coronavirus pandemic</a> is making Earth vibrate less</h2>

      <p>Around the world, seismologists are observing
      a lot less ambient seismic noise -- meaning, the vibrations generated by cars,
      trains, buses and people going about their daily lives. And in the absence of
      that noise, Earth's upper crust is moving just a little less.</p>

      <p>Thomas Lecocq, a geologist and seismologist at the Royal
      Observatory in Belgium, first pointed out this
      phenomenon in Brussels.</p>

      <p>Brussels is seeing about a 30% to 50% reduction in ambient
      seismic noise since mid-March, around the time the country started
      implementing school and business closures and other social distancing
      measures, according to Lecocq. That noise level is on par with what
      seismologists would see on Christmas Day, he said.</p>
