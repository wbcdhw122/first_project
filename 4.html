    <p>Netflix, Inc. is an American media-services provider and production
    company headquartered in Los Gatos, California, founded in 1997 by Reed
    Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's
    primary business is its subscription-based streaming service which offers
    online streaming of a library of films and television programs, including
    those produced in-house. As of April 2019, Netflix had over 148 million
    paid subscriptions worldwide, including 60 million in the United States,
    and over 154 million subscriptions total including free trials. It is
    available worldwide except in mainland China (due to local restrictions),
    Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to U.S. sanctions). The company also
    has offices in India, Netherlands, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea. Netflix
    is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).</p>

    <p>Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail,
    but Hastings abandoned the sales about a year after the company's founding
    to focus on the initial DVD rental business. Netflix expanded its
    business in 2010 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining
    the DVD and Blu-ray rental business. The company expanded internationally
    in 2010 with streaming available in Canada, followed by Latin America
    and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2012,
    debuting its first series Lilyhammer.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:300px;">Since 2012, Netflix has taken more of an active role as producer and distributor
    for both film and television series, and to that end, it offers a variety of
    "Netflix Original" content through its online library.By January 2016,
    Netflix services operated in more than 190 countries.Netflix released an
    estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, more than any other network or
    cable channel. Their efforts to produce new content, secure the rights for
    additional content, and diversify through 190 countries have resulted in the company
    racking up billions in debt: $21.9 billion as of September 2017, up from $16.8 billion
    from the previous year. $6.5 billion of this is long-term debt, while the remaining
    is in long-term obligations. In October 2018, Netflix announced it would raise another
    $2 billion in debt to help fund new content.</p>
